# 02-triki-game

This is the second project in which I learned how to reuse components with the help of props and organize the files in a better way to avoid confusion in the future.

On top of that, I learned the concept of React hooks. The one I used for this project was useState, which helped me a lot when it came to changing the state of a value in the component.
